# Constrained Genomic Selection Indices

Implements constrained genomic selection index methods using GEBVs.
These methods allow breeders to impose restrictions on genetic gains
while maintaining genomic selection efficiency.

Methods included: - Restricted Linear Genomic Selection Index (RLGSI) -
Predetermined Proportional Gains Linear Genomic Selection Index
(PPG-LGSI) - Combined Restricted Linear Genomic Selection Index
(CRLGSI) - Combined Predetermined Proportional Gains Linear Genomic
Selection Index (CPPG-LGSI)
