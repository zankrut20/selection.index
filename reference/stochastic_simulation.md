# Stochastic Simulation of Selection Indices (Chapter 10)

Implements stochastic simulation methods for evaluating the long-term
performance of selection indices over multiple breeding cycles. These
methods model linkage between loci using Haldane's mapping function and
track genetic gain across generations.

Methods included: - Haldane's mapping function for recombination -
Multi-cycle simulation framework - Comparisons of LPSI, ESIM, RLPSI, and
RESIM over time
