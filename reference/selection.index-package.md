# selection.index: Analysis of Selection Index in Plant Breeding

Provides tools for the simultaneous improvement of multiple traits in
plant breeding. Building upon the classical selection index (Smith 1937
[doi:10.1111/j.1469-1809.1936.tb02143.x](https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1469-1809.1936.tb02143.x)
) and modern quantitative genetics (Kang 2020
[doi:10.1007/978-3-319-91223-3](https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-319-91223-3)
), this package calculates classical phenotypic, genomic,
marker-assisted, restricted/constrained, and eigen selection indices. It
also incorporates multi-stage selection evaluation and stochastic
simulations to estimate genetic advance based on economic weights,
heritability, and genetic correlations.
