Description: The aim of most plant breeding programmes is simultaneous 
  improvement of several characters. An objective method involving simultaneous 
  selection for several attributes then becomes necessary. It has been 
  recognised that most rapid improvements in the economic value is expected from 
  selection applied simultaneously to all the characters which determine the 
  economic value of a plant, and appropriate assigned weights to each character 
  according to their economic importance, heritability and correlations between 
  characters. So the selection for economic value is a complex matter. If the 
  component characters are combined together into an index in such a way that 
  when selection is applied to the index, as if index is the character to be 
  improved, most rapid improvement of economic value is expected. Such an index 
  was first proposed by Smith (1937 <https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1469-1809.1936.tb02143.x>)
  based on the Fisher's (1936 <https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1469-1809.1936.tb02137.x>)
  "discriminant function" Dabholkar (1999 <https://books.google.co.in/books?id=mlFtumAXQ0oC&lpg=PA4&ots=Xgxp1qLuxS&dq=elements%20of%20biometrical%20genetics&lr&pg=PP1#v=onepage&q&f=false>).
  In this package selection index is calculated based on the Smith (1937) 
  selection index method.
