Description: Provides tools for the simultaneous improvement of multiple traits in plant breeding. Building upon the classical selection index (Smith 1937 <doi:10.1111/j.1469-1809.1936.tb02143.x>) and modern quantitative genetics (Kang 2020 <doi:10.1007/978-3-319-91223-3>), this package calculates classical phenotypic, genomic, marker-assisted, restricted/constrained, and eigen selection indices. It also incorporates multi-stage selection evaluation and stochastic simulations to estimate genetic advance based on economic weights, heritability, and genetic correlations.
