\title{Linear Phenotypic Eigen Selection Index Methods (Chapter 7)}
\description{
Implements the Linear Phenotypic Eigen Selection Index methods from Chapter 7.
These methods resolve index coefficients by maximizing the accuracy squared
(rho_HI^2) through an eigenvalue problem rather than requiring pre-specified
economic weights.

Methods included:
- ESIM   : Linear Phenotypic Eigen Selection Index (Section 7.1)
- RESIM  : Linear Phenotypic Restricted Eigen Selection Index (Section 7.2)
- PPG-ESIM: Predetermined Proportional Gain Eigen Selection Index (Section 7.3)

All implementations use C++ primitives (math_primitives.cpp) for quadratic forms
and symmetric solves, while eigendecompositions use R's eigen() for correctness
and compatibility with the existing package architecture.

\section{Mathematical Foundation}{


Unlike classical LPSI which requires economic weights w, the ESIM family resolves
the index vector b_E by maximizing the squared accuracy:
\deqn{\rho_{HI}^2 = \frac{b'Cb}{b'Pb}}
leading to the generalized eigenproblem \eqn{(\mathbf{P}^{-1}\mathbf{C} - \lambda^2 I)b = 0}.

The largest eigenvalue lambda_E^2 equals the maximum achievable index heritability,
and the corresponding eigenvector b_E contains the optimal index coefficients.
