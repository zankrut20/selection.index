\title{Generic C++ Math Primitives for Experimental Design Statistics}
\description{
Generic mathematical operations optimized with C++/Eigen.
No design-specific logic - purely mathematical primitives that can be
orchestrated by R code to implement any experimental design.

This architecture allows:
- Easy addition of new experimental designs (in R only)
- C++ speed for heavy computation
- Single source of truth (design_stats.R)
- Better maintainability and testability
}
