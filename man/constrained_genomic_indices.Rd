\title{Constrained Genomic Selection Indices}
\description{
Implements constrained genomic selection index methods using GEBVs.
These methods allow breeders to impose restrictions on genetic gains
while maintaining genomic selection efficiency.

Methods included:
- Restricted Linear Genomic Selection Index (RLGSI)
- Predetermined Proportional Gains Linear Genomic Selection Index (PPG-LGSI)
- Combined Restricted Linear Genomic Selection Index (CRLGSI)
- Combined Predetermined Proportional Gains Linear Genomic Selection Index (CPPG-LGSI)
