\title{Multistage Linear Phenotypic Selection Indices (Chapter 9)}
\description{
Implements multistage phenotypic selection index methods from Chapter 9.
These methods involve selection across multiple stages with covariance
adjustments due to selection effects using Cochran/Cunningham's method.

Methods included:
- MLPSI: Multistage Linear Phenotypic Selection Index (Section 9.1)
- MRLPSI: Multistage Restricted Linear Phenotypic Selection Index (Section 9.2)
- MPPG-LPSI: Multistage Predetermined Proportional Gain LPSI (Section 9.3)

All implementations use C++ primitives for mathematical operations.
