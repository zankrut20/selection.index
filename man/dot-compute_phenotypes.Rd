\title{Compute Phenotypic Values with Environmental Noise}
\usage{
.compute_phenotypes(genetic_values, environmental_variance)
}
\arguments{
\item{genetic_values}{Matrix of genetic values (n_individuals x n_traits)}

\item{environmental_variance}{Vector of environmental variances (constant across cycles)}
}
\value{
Matrix of phenotypic values (n_individuals x n_traits)
}
\description{
Adds environmental variation to genetic values to create phenotypic observations.

**IMPORTANT**: Environmental variance should be calculated ONCE at generation 0
and held constant across all cycles. Recalculating var_e each generation
artificially maintains heritability and overestimates genetic gain (fails to
model the Bulmer effect correctly).
